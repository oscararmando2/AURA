## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Video doesn't show?

- **Check:** Is the name exactly `pilates-background.mp4`? (case-sensitive)

### Text not visible?
- The overlay should make it visible
- If not, check browser console (F12) for errors

### Video doesn't play?
- Some browsers block autoplay
- The gradient background will show as fallback
- Try clicking on the page to trigger playback
